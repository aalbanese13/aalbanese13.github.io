        <title>The Rise of the Digital Nomad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of time, or, as far back as any of us can remember anyway, we have basically been taught to go to school and get a good job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when that time came, many of us did just that. We went to school, we got the degree, we got the job. (Yay!)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… you’re 22, developing back problems from your, let’s face it, not-so-ergonomic swivel chair, growing a belly from all the office donuts and trying not to rocket launch out the door until at least 5:07pm, because you wouldn’t want to seem too eager to leave the job you’re so lucky to have, right?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then what… is this the chair you’ll be sitting in for the next 30 years?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you have to listen to Marge in Accounting hack her phlegmy cigarette cough every day for the next THIRTY YEARS!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it like that for everyone? Of course not. Many people love their jobs, their bosses, office politics and stay until 5:08 because they WANT to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And good for those people. But we’re not talking about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you do it? It’s one of the most common questions I’m asked as a digital nomad. The concept seems foreign to many who have spent their lives working in offices and since it’s still so new, there can be a lot of confusion as to what exactly a “digital nomad” is or does.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask any grandparent to explain the idea of location independence and you’ll likely be met with a blank stare from beneath their glasses. Affiliate marketing? E-commerce? Virtual assistance? Social media management?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Say whaaaaat?&lt;/p span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A digital nomad is simply someone who earns their money online and travels while doing so. This income can come from a number of things depending on your skill set that these days, can translate into work done from a laptop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a person with a background in communications might pursue online marketing like building sales funnels, Facebook advertising or writing drip email marketing campaigns. Creatives can make money online by designing websites, graphics or writing. People who studied business can develop strategy and manage projects using a myriad of web based tools.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s really no limit to the kind of work you can do online. Obviously you can’t mow lawns online but you CAN generate leads through www.henriquethemower.com
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connectivity is constant now and it’s become more crucial than ever to get your business online. If you don’t have a website, you are absolutely, 100% missing out on potential business.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Internet isn’t going anywhere, have you seen all the little kids with iPads? They’ll kill you in Candy Crush and I &lt;i&gt;guarantee&lt;/i&gt; they know how to use the front facing camera better than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of new apps and software updates every day and if you’re not up to speed, you’re falling behind. Good luck updating your Mac to the current version from OS X Mountain Lion. You &lt;i&gt;neanderthal&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of technology coupled with astronomical living costs across the U.S, U.K., Canada and other first world countries has led people to seek opportunity elsewhere. And they’re finding it online and in pockets around the world that offer a higher quality of life at a more affordable price.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And bonus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;VIBRANT. CULTURAL. EXPERIENCES.&lt;/p span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the “nomad” part of “digital nomad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of travel has become much cheaper in recent years, with the introduction of low cost airlines and comfortable yet affordable accommodation like those featured on sites like AirBnb. Most nomads tend to stick to the “hot spots” where the cost of living is fairly low for a high quality of life. Countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico, Portugal and Hungary are a few places that strike this balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rent, food, beer, transportation, pretty much everything is cheaper in these countries. You might not be able to find your favorite brand of shampoo or a Whole Foods, but most of your needs will be met. This includes good, healthy food, a nice place to live, access to gyms, yoga studios, etc. There’s not a WHOLE lot of things you’ll find in the U.S. for example that you couldn’t find in most developed cities for much, much less.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, if anyone finds almond butter in Medellin for less than $18, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, the community of those 22 year olds that got fed up of Marge in Accounting have mobilized. They’ve (we’ve!) taken their skills on the road, found a beach somewhere that has a cafe with WiFi and decided to work from there instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is Service Design and Why Should You Care?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Service design is an important pillar of design that you probably never think about. It’s the reason why when you call a service provider, your call is picked up quickly or you end up listening to god awful hold music until you want to gouge your eyes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service design at its highest level, is the &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;design of a customer experience&lt;/span&gt;. An effective service design is the creation and implementation of a well thought out plan of experiences through both tangible and intangible channels over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service design looks at an entire ecosystem of a customer experience rather than isolated points of contact. To put it in perspective;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Usability&lt;/span&gt; is the focus on a particular functionality&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;User Experience Design&lt;/span&gt; is the focus on a single touch point&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Service Design&lt;/span&gt; is the focus on all touch points for the whole experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes digital touch points like mobile and the web, physical touch points such as print and products, and intangible mediums like marketing and consumer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;For Example:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligentsia is a specialty coffee chain with consistent service design throughout their shops in Chicago, New York and LA. When you walk in, you’ll notice that their menu isn’t prominently displayed like it is in many coffee shops. You actually have to walk up to the counter and grab a menu to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not by accident. It’s to encourage an interaction with the barista, whether it’s just saying hello or asking questions about what you should order. This small detail helps create a more personal experience with the Intelligentsia brand that customers remember and come back for again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, service design in effect.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service design is best when it’s entirely undetectable to the user. It enhances the utility, performance and value of an offering and the product becomes easier and more enjoyable to use. When the customer journey is the focal point the end result is smoother, with rough patches that may have been otherwise overlooked, fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A compelling experience with a brand, whether it’s a physical product, customer service or the culture created is almost always a direct result of a well thought out service design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Designing a service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; it is, you might be wondering &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;.
Services are designed similarly to other experiences, like apps and websites; with design thinking. The same approach applies and following the “double diamond” method is helpful to arriving at an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Discover&lt;/span&gt; — identify a general problem and explore that through research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Define&lt;/span&gt; — analyze research and form insights, leading to defining a more specific problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Develop&lt;/span&gt; — ideate and refine concepts to solve specific problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Deliver&lt;/span&gt; — prototype and ideally, arrive at a specific solution for the specific problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The key steps to remember in designing a service are; create, validate, revise.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you come up with a potential solution, you want to make sure that it’s relevant to your user and if not, improve upon it. This is meant to be an iterative process that is focused on being user centered, co-creative, sequenced and holistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think about the design of a service broken down into the following parts; &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;front stage, back stage and partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front stage is where the user interacts with your brand and the back stage is where all of the behind the scenes work to support the front stage takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partners includes the other businesses needed to complete an action. For example, Intelligentsia sells coffee but they rely on a partnership with coffee bean growers and roasters to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, there are different touch points. These touch points include the Five P’s; people, props, place, partnerships, processes, as explained by Cooper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;People,&lt;/span&gt; including employees and other customers encountered while the service is produced&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Place,&lt;/span&gt; such as the physical space or the virtual environment through which the service is delivered&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Props,&lt;/span&gt; such as the objects and collateral used to produce the service encounter&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Partners,&lt;/span&gt; including other businesses or entities that help produce or enhance the service&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Processes,&lt;/span&gt; such as the workflows and rituals that are used to produce the service (this relates the people, place, props and partners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to demonstrate these clearly, you can develop artifacts like experience maps, service blueprints or ecosystem maps that elaborate on each touch point, channel, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service design is an important asset of any busines that will help differentiate themselves from the competition and creating a lasting impression on their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s Service Design 101!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you’ll find this information useful and will take it into account in your next design venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
